This is the GitHub organization of the Green Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Working group of [Informatics Europe](https://www.informatics-europe.org/society/green-ict.html). We use this organization to manage shared projects.

## About Us
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a dual role in Europe's pursuit of sustainability. On the one hand, it acts as a catalyst for societal modernization, optimizing processes in sectors like transport, healthcare, and building management, thus potentially reducing carbon footprints. On the other hand, the sector itself is a significant energy consumer, with, for example, data centers alone accounting for 2-3% of global energy usage. In line with the European Green Deal of 2019, which sets an ambitious target for Europe to become carbon neutral by 2050, a balanced approach is required. This involves developing an efficient, optimized ICT infrastructure with minimal environmental impact, while simultaneously leveraging these technologies to further sustainability in all societal sectors. This delicate equilibrium between ICT growth and environmental preservation is at the core of Europe's sustainable future, and therefore, our group is working on improving the ICT environment for that goal; for more information, visit our [website](https://www.informatics-europe.org/society/green-ict.html).
